# Poly Guard

Poly Guard is an all-in-one moderation bot for Discord that can be easily deployed to your own bot

This repo is based off an Autocode app ([modisfakenews](https://autocode.com/app/lifn/modeisfakenews)), the original standard lib code remains in the [lifeisfakenews/autocode-apps](https://github.com/lifeisfakenews/autocode-apps)

There are plans for a TypeScript rewrite.
Please expect this around July - August 2024
